# Actionable Items Page

## Purpose

The Actionable Items page displays decision prompts derived from GEO signals. These items are generated by the Strategy Agent and provide actionable recommendations for improving GEO performance. The page is review-only with no execution capabilities.

## Page Route

`/decisions/actionable-items`

## Data Source

- **Primary Agent**: Strategy Agent
- **Supporting Agents**: Reasoning Agent (for rationale), Governance Agent (for governance checks)
- **Data Type**: Read-only decision prompts from agent outputs

## Page Sections

### A) Header
- Page title: "Actionable Items"
- Subtitle: "Decision prompts derived from GEO signals. Review-only — no execution."

### B) Summary Strip
- Displays: "Items: X · High priority: Y · Governance warnings: Z"
- Source note: "Primary output: Strategy Agent (non-executable)."

### C) Filters
- **Focus Area**: Filter by content area (Content Coverage, Structural Improvement, etc.)
- **Risk**: Filter by risk level (low, medium, high)
- **Sort**: Sort by Confidence or Priority
- All filters are client-side only (no API calls)

### D) Items List
Each item card displays:
- **Title** with badges for focus area, priority, and risk level
- **Description** (2-3 lines)
- **Confidence indicator** (compact percentage label + thin progress bar)
- **Accordion: "Rationale (Reasoning Agent)"** - Shows rationale summary from Reasoning Agent
- **Accordion: "Evidence (Signals)"** - Lists evidence items
- **Governance badge** - Shows warning if governance status is "warning"
- **Governance note** - Compact, collapsible note area (1-2 lines preview, expandable for details)
- **Footer**:
  - Left: Local "Acknowledge" checkbox (UI-only, no persistence, avoids task-completion semantics)
  - Right: Link to Execution Brief page with `?from=<item_id>` parameter

### E) Optional Drawer (Nice-to-have)
- Right-side drawer for detailed item view when clicking a card
- Not implemented in initial version

### F) Footer Boundary
- Clear statement: "Decision-only. No execution."

## Read-Only Boundary

### What This Page Does
- ✅ Displays decision prompts from Strategy Agent
- ✅ Allows filtering and sorting (client-side only)
- ✅ Shows rationale and evidence for each item
- ✅ Provides navigation to Execution Brief page
- ✅ Local UI state (acknowledge checkbox)

### What This Page Does NOT Do
- ❌ Execute any actions
- ❌ Trigger agent calls
- ❌ Publish content
- ❌ Generate recommendations
- ❌ Modify data
- ❌ Persist acknowledge state
- ❌ Track execution status
- ❌ Task management (no due dates, assignees, workflows)

## Handoff Behavior

### Navigation to Execution Brief
- Clicking "View Execution Brief" navigates to `/execution-prep/execution-briefs?from=<item_id>`
- This is a navigation-only action (no data transfer, no API calls)
- The Execution Brief page can use the `from` query parameter to highlight the originating item

### No Execution Handoff
- This page does NOT trigger execution
- This page does NOT send data to execution systems
- Navigation is the only handoff mechanism

## UI Patterns

### Allowed Patterns
- View-only data display
- Client-side filtering and sorting
- Accordion sections for details
- Local UI state (acknowledge checkbox - avoids task semantics)
- Navigation links
- Badges for categorization
- Compact progress bars for confidence

### Forbidden Patterns
- Execution buttons
- "Generate", "Execute", "Publish", "Autopilot" wording
- Task management UI (due dates, assignees, status workflows)
- Task completion semantics ("Reviewed", "Completed", etc.)
- API calls
- Agent execution triggers
- Publishing controls
- Status tracking

## Data Structure

The page uses demo data from `/lib/demo/geo-os/actionable-items.ts` with the following structure:

- `meta`: Page metadata, snapshot ID, source agents
- `items[]`: Array of actionable items, each containing:
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `title`: Item title
  - `description`: 2-3 line description
  - `focus_area`: Category (Content Coverage, Structural Improvement, etc.)
  - `confidence`: 0-1 confidence score
  - `source_agent`: "Strategy"
  - `priority`: "low" | "medium" | "high"
  - `risk_level`: "low" | "medium" | "high"
  - `evidence`: Array of evidence strings
  - `rationale`: Object with `summary` and `source_agent` ("Reasoning")
  - `governance`: Object with `status` ("approved" | "warning") and optional `notes`

## Agent Attribution

- **Strategy Agent**: Primary source for all actionable items
- **Reasoning Agent**: Provides rationale summaries (displayed in "Rationale (Reasoning Agent)" accordion)
- **Governance Agent**: Provides governance status and warnings

## UI Refinements

### Confidence Indicator
- Compact design with thin progress bar (h-1)
- Clear numeric label: "Confidence: XX%"
- Reduced visual dominance while maintaining clarity

### Accordion Labels
- Explicitly read-only labels:
  - "Rationale (Reasoning Agent)" - clearly indicates source and purpose
  - "Evidence (Signals)" - clearly indicates signal-based evidence

### Governance Warning
- Badge remains visible for quick identification
- Note area is compact (1-2 line preview)
- Collapsible for full details when needed
- Maintains visual hierarchy without overwhelming

### Acknowledge Checkbox
- Replaces "Reviewed" to avoid task-completion semantics
- UI-only state (no persistence)
- Indicates user has seen/acknowledged the item, not completed it

### Handoff CTA
- "View Execution Brief" (instead of "Open")
- Link-style presentation
- Navigation-only action

## Future Considerations

When backend integration is added:
- Replace demo data with API calls
- Add loading states
- Add error handling
- Implement snapshot selection
- Add time range filtering
- Consider implementing drawer for detailed item view
