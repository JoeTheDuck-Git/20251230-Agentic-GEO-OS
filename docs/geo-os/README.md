# Agentic GEO OS

## What is Agentic GEO OS?

Agentic GEO OS (Generative Engine Optimization Operating System) is an autonomous system designed to help brands understand and improve how they appear in AI-generated answers. Unlike traditional SEO tools that focus on search engine rankings, GEO OS focuses on:

- **AI Overviews**: How brands appear in Google's AI Overviews
- **LLM Responses**: Presence in ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLM-generated answers
- **Generative Search**: Visibility in next-generation search experiences

## How It Differs from SEO Tools

### Traditional SEO
- Focuses on keyword rankings
- Measures organic traffic and CTR
- Optimizes for search engine algorithms
- Tracks backlinks and domain authority

### GEO OS
- Focuses on question-based sampling
- Measures visibility and sentiment in AI answers
- Optimizes for AI model understanding
- Tracks brand mentions and positioning in generated content

## Core Philosophy

GEO OS operates on the principle that AI-generated answers are the new search results. Brands need to:

1. **Observe** how AI models currently represent them
2. **Measure** visibility and sentiment across topics
3. **Reason** about gaps and opportunities
4. **Act** with content, structure, and authority improvements

## System Architecture

The system is built as an OS with four distinct layers:

1. **Observation Layer**: Captures AI answers and detects brand presence
2. **Intelligence Layer**: Computes GEO Scores and aggregates insights
3. **Reasoning Layer**: Identifies gaps and prioritizes actions (agentic)
4. **Action Layer**: Generates executable recommendations
